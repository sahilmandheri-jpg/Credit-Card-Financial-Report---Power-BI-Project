**Graduates Are the Volume kings**

**Analysis of Delinquency Patterns**

 Account delinquency shows no direct correlation with education or job type. However,  on the basis of education Doctorate and Unknown segments exhibit slightly higher delinquency rates. But  states like AR, AZ, and CO have zero delinquents (but each state have 15 or less customers), While on the other hand IA, MA, and PA report a delinquency rate exceeding 10%.

Action :- Bank should shrink the credit limit of the states exceeding 10% barrier until the delinquency rate comes to 7-8% or less.

only 67 customers are using platinum card and their average income is 189k(almost thrice of blue card average), but 105 customers are still using blue card who are earning more than 190k. These should be converted into Platinum users.
